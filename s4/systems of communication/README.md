# Communications Systems

This folder redirects to a repository with the most of my exercises in the lesson of communications systems. They use javascript in most cases, integrating google charts for the different purposes of every task.

So, you can see them live in the following link [apostolos172.github.io/communication-systems/](https://apostolos172.github.io/communication-systems/) or see the source code [github.com/Apostolos172/communication-systems](https://github.com/Apostolos172/communication-systems).
